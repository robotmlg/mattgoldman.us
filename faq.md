Through my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/robotmlg) or [email](mailto:matt+faq@mattgoldman.us), which can all be found by clicking the links, or in the footer.

### Where are you from?
I was born and raised in New Jersey, specifically Madison and Bedminster. I graduated from Far Hills Country Day School in 2008 and Bernards High School in 2012. In 2016 I graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.

My sport of choice to watch on TV is ice hockey, and I root for the New Jersey Devils, the only professional sports team brave enough to brand itself after New Jersey.

Four.  In 2012, I was on the game show *The Challenge*, airing on MSG Varsity, with my high school's team.  *The Challenge* is hosted by [Jared Cotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cotter), who has a bacon number of 3, according to [OracleOfBacon.org](http://oracleofbacon.org/).
