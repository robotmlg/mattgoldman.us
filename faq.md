#FAQ

### Who are you?
I’m just this guy, you know? You may know me from when I was voted TIME Magazine‘s Person of the Year in 2006.

### How can I contact you?
Through my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/robotmlg), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/robotmlg), or [email](mailto:matt+faq@mattgoldman.us), which can all be found by clicking the links, or in the footer.

### Where are you from?
I was born and raised in New Jersey, specifically Madison and Bedminster. I graduated from Far Hills Country Day School in 2008 and Bernards High School in 2012. I’m currently studying for a Computer Science degree at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.

### What’s your favorite caffeinated beverage?
I drink mostly coffee, although I do occasionally drink tea. Soda is for losers.

### What sports do you enjoy?
My sport of choice to watch on TV is ice hockey, and I root for the New Jersey Devils, the only professional sports team brave enough to brand itself after New Jersey.

### What's your favorite text editor?
Vim, but everyone knows that [*real* programmers use Butterflies](http://xkcd.com/378/).

### What's your [Bacon Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers)?
Four.  In 2012, I was on the game show *The Challege*, airing on MSG Varsity, with my high school's team.  *The Challenge* is hosted by [Jared Cotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cotter), who has a bacon number of 3, according to [OracleOfBacon.org](http://oracleofbacon.org/).  Therefore, my Bacon Number is 4.
